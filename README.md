# generator

The program takes two numbers and applies different number generator on each one to generate x amount of numbers.

So we end up with the two arrays with x amount of numbers in each.

Then each number in array is converted to its binary equivelent and then the last 8 digits are compared.

The program returns how many times the the last 8 digits were equal in both arrays.
